##1 Welcome to TMW-LoF V2!

##0 We have updated our content to the latest version of
##0 TMWA. This gives us features like quest logs and
##0 exact mob health reporting, but the massive changes
##0 needed have caused some bugs, some of which have
##0 probably not been found. If you find one, please 
##0 mention it in-game and post the details in the bugs
##0 thread on the forum!

##3 -- The LoF Dev Team

##0 Tulimshar finally approved Carston's plans to move his
##0 inn towards the residential district and the planned
##0 trade route. The one condition was that he clean up the
##0 mess that would be left behind. He reciprocated by
##0 setting a new outdoor hangout for adventurers nestled
##0 in with the warp gates. You may have find a new place
##0 to sit....
